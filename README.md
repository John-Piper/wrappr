wrappr is a small collection of wrapper functions to help with the
development of writing cleaner R code.

The helper functions in wrappr can help with setting temporarily working
directories to help open files, using a only a file name, maintaining
the current working directory. Messages can be print to the console
before and after a function call to another function. Also wrappr can
help speed up development time when using large data frames collected
from file when running the same source code multipal times.
